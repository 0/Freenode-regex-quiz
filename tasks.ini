title=Capitalizing I
description=Use $!regsub() to replace every occurrence of the word i with the word I (uppercase, I as in me). ie: 3i'm replacing it. am i not? -> 3I'm replacing it. am I not?. 14Submit your solution as !try s/pattern/subst/[modifiers]  A regex match is replaced with the text <subst> when using $!regsub()

[task3]
title=Uppercase Consonants
description=Since $!regex() returns the number of matches, can you make it return the number of uppercase consonants (B,C,D,F,..,Z) in a given string? eg: it should return6 3 with the text "3ABcDeFO!".

finalMessage=You should know that HTML tags are way more complicated than this. You should in reality never use regex to parse HTML, but there are cases when it is "okay"; these cases being quick and dirty job in a local text document or similar.
