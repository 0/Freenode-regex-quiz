filter porn
You're matching one of the exceptions! Your lookahead should be anchored to the start of text with 6^. Try examples with an exception and a spam word in the string, like 6filter porn. If the regex engine has the pointer in "filter 3<here>porn" it matches porn, and a negative lookahead in that position will return true, making it match when you don't want it to.
