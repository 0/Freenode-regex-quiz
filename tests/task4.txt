; Task 4: Retreive Numbers
; Match all integers in the string.

== 0
1
Failed to match a single digit. How about 06[0-9], or the equivalent 06\d?

!= 1
12
Match longer numbers as well as single digits. You can count past 9, can't you?

!= 1
34567890958473656489033209384767389209
Why stop at one or two digits? Integers can be of any length.

!= 0
afkuhguhw_iugh
Match only numbers, not letters.

== 1
1.2
Don't match non-integer values (such as 063.14159) as a single value. That's a later task!

== 5
12345
Adjacent integers that run into each other become one integer. For example, "12345" is one integer, not five of them.

== 0
abc12abc12abc
Failed to match numbers embedded in text.

== 1
abc12abc12abc
Forgot 06/g?

!= 2
abc12abc12abc
Failed to match two numbers separated by other symbols.

!= 3
1a2b3
Failed to match numbers separated by single letters.
