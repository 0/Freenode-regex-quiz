You must match 6integers. An integer is a sequence of decimal digits, 030-039.

!= 1
3748.3756387
You must match simple floating point numbers. Two 6integers separated by a 6dot (3".") or 6comma (3",").

!= 1
3748,3756387
You must match simple floating point numbers. Two 6integers separated by a 6dot (3".") or 6comma (3",").

!= 1
-123.456
You must allow a 6negative sign (3"-").

!= 1
+123.456
You must allow a 6positive sign (3"+").

!= 1
123.456e789
You must allow an 6exponent part, separated by an 3"e".

!= 1
123.456E789
The 6exponent could also be in upper-case.

!= 1
.123
A leading 6dot must be allowed.

!= 1
123.
A trailing 6dot must be allowed.

!= 0
123..
Multiple 6dots must not be allowed.

!= 0
+-1
Only one 6sign is allowed.

!= 0
123.456,789
Only one 6dot or 6comma is allowed.

!= 0
123x456
You forgot to escape the 3".".

!= 1
1.0e-5
The exponent can also have a 6sign.

!= 0
.
Just a 3"." is not a valid floating number.
