abc
You should 03only match 06numbers.

!= 1
1234
You must match 06integers. An integer is a sequence of decimal digits (030-039).

!= 0
abc123abc
Your expression implies 03"abc123abc" is a valid floating point number... I'm quite sure it's not.

!= 0
abc123
Your expression implies 03"abc123" is a valid floating point number... I'm quite sure it's not.

!= 0
123abc
Your expression implies 03"123abc" is a valid floating point number... I'm quite sure it's not.

!= 0
1a2b3c
Your expression implies 03"1a2b3c" is a valid floating point number... I'm quite sure it's not.

123x456
You forgot to escape the 03".". Don't forget that it's a metacharacter!

!= 1
3748.3756387
You must match simple floating point numbers. Two 06integers separated by a 06dot (03".") or 06comma (03",").

!= 1

You must match simple floating point numbers. Two 06integers separated by a 06dot (03".") or 06comma (03",").

!= 1
-123.456
You must allow a 06negative sign (03"-").

!= 1
+123.456
You must allow a 06positive sign (03"+").

!= 1
1.2e2
You must allow an 06exponent part, separated by an 03"e". For example, 061.2e2

!= 1
923.456e789
You must allow an 06exponent part, separated by an 03"e". For example, 060.314159e1.

!= 1
823.456E789
The 06exponent separator could also be in uppercase.

!= 1
3.e2
You have got the basic idea right, but sometimes the "exponent" comes directly after the separator (comma or dot). For example, 063.e2

!= 1
3,e2
You have got the basic idea right, but sometimes the "exponent" comes directly after the separator (comma or dot). For example, 063.e2

!= 1
+3,e2
You must allow a 06positive sign (03"+") even if there's an exponent in the number.

!= 1
+3.e2
You must allow a 06positive sign (03"+") even if there's an exponent in the number.
