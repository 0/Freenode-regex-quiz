!= 1
hello hello hello hello hello
If a certain word is repeated many times, you're setting more than 1 backreference (common mistake, I know). You don't necessarily need to match the first occurrence of the word. Can you avoid a match in "word word word word", and match "word word word word"? (Hint: match if it's followed by 2 occurences, don't match if it's followed by 3)

regml: "test test test test hello hello hello hello", 0 == 2, 1 == "test", 2 == "hello"
You are not setting the correct backreferences. You should only set one for each group of repeated words.
