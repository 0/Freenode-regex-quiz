; repeated words, task 14

== 0
hello hello hello
You're not matching repeated words at all.

!= 0
hellohellohello
You should only match repeated 3words. You should know what this is by now.

!= 0
hej hej hej
You're matching words that do not fit the description.

!= 0
a a a
You're matching words that do not fit the description.

!= 0
one two three
You're matching strings with no repeated words.

!= 1
test TEST tEsT
You're regex is case sensitive? How did you even get to this task?

word word word word
It doesn't match "word word word word". Remember that after a lookaround, the regex engine goes back to the position it was before attempting the assertion. It's explained in 12http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround2.html

!= 0
h&llo h&llo h&llo h&llo
You should only match repeated 03words.

== 0
word! -word! (word)
You haven't learned about word boundaries yet? It doesn't match "word! -word! (word)".

== 0
l33t l33t l33t
Any idea why it didn't return the word "l33t". Some people "7alk lik3 7ha7" on irc. You can use \w for a word character (\w matches 6[A-Za-z0-9_]).

!= 0
word word wordnot
Not working, sorry. Read the task again. It matches 6word word wordnot. Should I remind you of word boundaries again?

!= 0
word notword word
Not working, sorry. Read the task again. It matches 6word word wordnot. Should I remind you of word boundaries again?

<= 1
test test test hello hello hello
It returns the first word, but what if there were 2 words repeated? Did you by any chance forget about the  global modifier? If your expression is global already, but you can't get past this error you need to look over the greedyness of your pattern. You are most likely allowing the engine to consume too much.

!= 1
hello hello hello hello hello
If a certain word is repeated many times, you're setting more than 1 backreference (common mistake, I know). You don't necessarily need to match the first occurrence of the word. Can you avoid a match in "word word word word", and match "word word word word"? (Hint: match if it's followed by 2 occurences, don't match if it's followed by 3)

regml: test test test test hello hello hello hello, 0 != 2, 1 != test, 2 != hello
You are not setting the correct backreferences. You should only set one for each group of repeated words.

word1 word2 word1 word2 word1 word2
It's not working when more than 1 word is repeated. Try 06"word1 word2 word1 word2 word1 word2". The engine is probably consuming chars for the first match, not allowing the second match to occur. Can you think of a regex construct that doesn't consume the chars?

If you think about it, 03{2,} is exactly the same as 03{2} in a lookaround. Because a lookaround only returns true/false and the engine doesn't move. Thus, matching 03{2,} necessarily implies matching 03{2}. Please change it to make it more efficient.
