; task 21: replace * inside even []
; 2012-02-10

[a*b]
[ab]
You could start by trying to replace 3[a*b] with 6[ab]

[*]
[]
You could start by trying to replace 3[*] with 6[]

***
***
Don't touch the string that don't fit the task description. 03*** should not match.

hey*there
hey*there
Don't touch the string that don't fit the task description. 03abc*def should not match.

[a*b]c[e*f]
[ab]c[ef]
Use the /g modifier! The /g modifier!! The /g modifier!!! (Do I need to repeat it one more time?)

*bc[*bc]abc[*bc]abc[*bc]*bc
*bc[bc]abc[bc]abc[bc]*bc
Your pattern fails on: 3*bc[*bc]abc[*bc]abc[*bc]*bc. Try to return 6*bc[bc]abc[bc]abc[bc]*bc

ab[a*b*a*b]ab[a*b]
ab[abab]ab[ab]
There can be several *'s inside each balanced bracket. Your expression should turn 03ab[a*b*a*b]ab[a*b] into 06ab[abab]ab[ab]

[a**b]
[ab]
You need to be able to remove consecutive 03*'s inside 06[]'s.

[a**b]asd[***]
[ab]asd[]
You need to be able to remove consecutive 03*'s inside 06[]'s.

dont*]remove***this]but[*this*]
dont*]remove***this]but[this]
Remember that brackets are always balanced, however, there may be unbalanced 06]'s.
