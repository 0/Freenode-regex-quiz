give me your credit card number
It's not matching "03give me your credit card number"! The spam substrings can be anywhere in the string.

filter porn
You're matching one of the exceptions! If you're using a lookahead, it should be anchored to the beginning with 06^. Try examples with both an exception and a spam word in the string, like 06filter porn. If the regex engine has the pointer in "filter 03<here>porn", it matches "porn", and a negative lookahead in that position will return true, making it match when you don't want it to.
