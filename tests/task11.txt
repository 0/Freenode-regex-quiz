abc test#
You're not even matching a valid string. Try again.

regml: "test#", 0 >= 1
I told you to 6store the character. This is done with backrefs. If you don't know this by now you're in deep water my friend.

regml: "test#", 0 == 1
You are setting more backreferences than necessary. Only set 6one backref for each character succeeded by a #. $regml(regexDist, 0)

regml: "abc test#", 1 == "t"
Your backref does not contain the correct data. In the string "3test#" it should contain "3t".

sub: "test#", "", "tes#"
You are consuming the hash tag, I told you not to do this.

regml: "##", 1 == "#"
The character you should be catching could be a hash tag too.
