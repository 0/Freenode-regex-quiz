b4
b*
Your pattern doesn't match the text 3b4. It should replace it with 3b*. Match any char and a digit to start with.

12
1*
Just two consecutive digits should be straightforward.

1234
1*3*
Remember to replace only all digits in even positions of the string.

FOOBAR
FOOBAR
Don't touch non-digits!

4321
4*2*
Don't just replace all the even digits. Replace all those in the even position of the string.

foobar8
foobar8
The text 3foobar8 should remain unchanged. The regex engine will try to match in every position unless you anchor it somehow. Otherwise, it may attempt a match from 3fooba4<here>3r8. You must read 12http://www.regular-expressions.info/continue.html

a1b2cde3~g45hi6
a*b*cde*~g4*hi6
You were right to anchor it with \G. And you are replacing all digits that match from the beginning of the string. However, if there's a character which isn't a digit that you need to skip, you should also try to match it to allow a subsequent match in a digit. You're replacing 3a1b2cde3~g45hi6 with 3a*b*cde3~g45hi6 instead of 6a*b*cde*~g4*hi6

a1b2cdefg3
a*b*cdefg*
You didn't replace3 a1b2cdefg3 with6 a*b*cdefg*

sub: 12a45, USER_INPUT, ===, 1*a4*
The digit you replace isn't required to follow another digit.

sub: 12ab4c5, USER_INPUT, ===, 1*ab4c*
"Even position" refers to position in the entire string, not just among the digits.

validate: iswm, *{*_C_*}*, *{*_C_}*, *{?}*, *{??}*, *{???}* 
Pease don't cheat. It should replace a number in ANY even position.
