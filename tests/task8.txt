A tag is a started by a 03"<", and ended by a 03">". For example, you should remove 03"<html>".

sub: asd<adf>lol<asd>, $null, ==, asd
You are overusing 06greedy quantifiers. For example, in the string "03a<b>c<d>e" you are returning "03ae" when you should be returning "03ace".

Forgot 03/g?

Closing tags start with 03"</", and end with 03">". For example, you should remove 03"</html>".

Also remove empty tags: 03"<>".

Tags can sometimes span multiple lines. Also remove 06partial tags, which may be missing either 03"<" or 03">" if they occur at the start or end of the string, respectively.

hfajshdf>jfh<jk>sdhf<sfhsjkdf

Both 06complete and 06partial tags can appear on a single line.

A tag (<03>06complete<03> or <03>06partial<03>) can contain more than just lowercase letters.
