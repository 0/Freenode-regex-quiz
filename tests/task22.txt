regml: (a + b), 0 !== 1, 1 !== (a + b)
It's not even matching 6(a + b)

regml: 2 + (x * (8 + b)) - (2 + 1), 0 != 2, 1 !== (x * (8 + b)), 2 !== (2 + 1)
It's not working. Try with the example I gave you!

regml: (a * (b + c) / d), 0 !== 2, 1 !== (a * (b + c) / d), 2 !== (b + c)
It matches the example alright, but it's still wrong when applied to 6(a * (b + c) / d).
