; Task 2: Capitalize
; Replace the word i with I.

i
I
You are not replacing 03i at all! Start with 03s/i/I/.

big
big
You are replacing 03i in the middle of words, but "03this is a string" should not be changed to "03th06I03s 06I03s a str06I03ng". Use your newly learned word boundary skills!

what am i
what am I
You are not replacing 03i at the end of the string.

i'm
I'm
You're not replacing the 03i in "03i'm".

abc i abc i abc i abc
abc I abc I abc I abc
You are not replacing all occurrences of 03i. 03I think 03I would very much l06ike to cap06ital06ize every "03I" 06in my sentences!

i i i
I I I
You are not replacing several occurrences of 03i in a row. Some people stutter; are they not allowed to capitalize their letters?
