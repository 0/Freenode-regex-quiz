; Task 6: Broken keyboard
; Remove repeated input

regml: "aaa", 0 < 1
You should start by setting a backreference to store the data in.

aaaaa
aaa
You should only remove strings that fit the task description. They are finite in length. For example, 03aaaaa should become 06aaa.

aaaaaa
aa
You're not replacing the strings according to the task description. For example, 03aaaaaa should become 06aa.

%%%aaabbbccczzzz!!!***
%abczz!*
You're not removing all types of repeated characters. It's not only the letter keys that get stuck, after all.

pplease
pplease
Don't alter strings that don't fit the description. You should not touch the string 06pplease. Only replace strings that match the task description (two consecutive repeats)

aa aa aa
aa aa aa
Don't replace strings that don't fit the description.

abc
abc
You're removing the wrong characters!

aaa
a
You are not removing the duplicate chars properly. Remember, I want to keep the character I initially typed. Only remove the duplicates!

aaammm
am
You're not removing all the duplicated characters! My keyboard might jam several 06tttimes in a sente06nnnce.

HHHHKKKKKK
HHKK
Capital letters can also occur in the string.

hHh hhh HHH KKk
hHh h H KKk
You need to remember that repeated characters are case sensitive!
