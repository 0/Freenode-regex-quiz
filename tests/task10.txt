abc test#
You're not even matching a valid string. Try again.

regml: "test#", 0 >= 1
I told you to 06capture the character. This is done with backreferences. If you don't know this by now, you're in deep water, my friend.

regml: "test#", 0 == 1
You are setting more backreferences than necessary. Only set 06one backreference for each character that is followed by a #. $regml(regexDist, 0)

regml: "abc test#", 1 == "t"
Your backreference does not contain the correct data. In the string "03abcd#" it should contain "03d".

sub: "test#", "", "!=", "tes#"
You are consuming the hash character, I told you not to do this.

!= 5
a#bc#def#ghij#klmno#
You are supposed to catch all occurrences!

regml: "##", 1 == "#"
The character you should be catching could be a hash character too.

!= 1
%#
Any character can be used in front of a hash character.

!= 1
7#
Any character can be used in front of a hash character.
