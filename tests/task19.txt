; replace text not code
; task 19
; 2012-01-29

micro
&micro;
Ouch. Start by replacing "micro" with "&micro;"

sub: lol text, $null, !=, lol text
You're matching any text! Type !task

sub: text micro, $null, ==, micro
You're matching the text before "micro". That's alright, but don't forget to include a backreference in the replacement text so as not to remove part of the text.

30 micromol/l
30 &micro;mol/l
It should replace: '0330 micromol/l' with '0330 &micro;mol/l'

micro asd micro asdasd micro
&micro; asd &micro; asdasd &micro;
It's not replacing a line with 3micro repeated several times.

sub: &micro;, &micro;, ==, &&micro;;
If it only was this simple... You're matching 06micro inside of 03&micro; which results in the invalid output 03&&micro;;

;this test is not really complete
<temicrost>&micro;micro micro<micro>
<temicrost>&micro;&micro; &micro;<micro>
It's matching a tag and replacing "micro" after the tag. However, if the text doesn't have "micro" after the tag, it's backtracking and matching "micro" inside a tag. You don't only have to match the tag; you also have to disallow matching a tag in the rest of the pattern.

&asdmicroasd;
&asdmicroasd;
It's matching "micro" inside an entity.

<lolmicrolol>
<lolmicrolol>
It's matching "micro" inside a tag.

&micro; micro
&micro; &micro;
It's not working. 03&micro; micro should become 06&micro; &micro;

&micro;mol/microl
&micro;mol/&micro;l
If there's an entity before "micro", your pattern fails. Example:3 &micro;mol/microl

&micro
&&micro;
An entity is only something that starts with 03& and ends with 03;, nothing else. It's not replacing 03"&micro" properly.

micro;
&micro;;
An entity is only something that starts with 03& and ends with 03;, nothing else. It's not replacing 03"micro;" properly.

<not a tag micro;
<not a tag &micro;;
Only disallow matching if "micro" is in a tag or an entity.

<not a tag micro
<not a tag &micro;
Only disallow matching if "micro" is in a tag or an entity.

<not a tag &micro
<not a tag &&micro;
Only disallow matching if "micro" is in a tag or an entity.

abc &micro what>
abc &&micro; what>
Only disallow matching if "micro" is in a tag or an entity.

abc micro; what>
abc &micro;; what>
Only disallow matching if "micro" is in a tag or an entity.

10 <a href="micromol/index.html">micromol</a>&micro;m&sup3;
10 <a href="micromol/index.html">&micro;mol</a>&micro;m&sup3;
You're not matching the text '0310 <a href="micromol/index.html">micromol</a>&micro;m&sup3;' correctly.

&i am microman<br />or not;
&i am &micro;man<br />or not;
It's not working. What about 3&i am microman<br />or not; You don't want to replace it?
