&micro;
Ouch. Start by replacing "micro" with "&micro;"

sub: lol text, $null, !=, lol text
You're matching any text! Type !task

30 micromol/l
30 &micro;mol/l
It should replace: '0330 micromol/l' with '0330 &micro;mol/l'

micro asd micro asdasd micro
&micro; asd &micro; asdasd &micro;
It's not replacing a line with 3micro repeated several times.

;this test is not really complete
<temicrost>&micro;micro
<temicrost>&micro;&micro;
It's matching a tag and replacing "micro" after the tag. However, if the text doesn't have "micro" after the tag, it's backtracking and matching "micro" inside a tag. You don't only have to match the tag; you also have to disallow matching a tag in the rest of the pattern.

&asdmicroasd;
&asdmicroasd;
It's matching "micro" inside an entity.

<lolmicrolol>
<lolmicrolol>
It's matching "micro" inside a tag.

&micro; micro
&micro; &micro;
It's not working. 03&micro; micro should become 06&micro; &micro;

10 <a href="micromol/index.html">micromol</a>&micro;m&sup3;
10 <a href="micromol/index.html">&micro;mol</a>&micro;m&sup3;
You're not matching the text '0310 <a href="micromol/index.html">micromol</a>&micro;m&sup3;' correctly.

&i am microman<br />or not;
&i am &micro;man<br />or not;
It's not working. What about 3&i am microman<br />or not; You don't want to replace it?
