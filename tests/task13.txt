; Task 13: Not Surrounded By Digits
; Replace . with - unless surrounded by \d.

; test below can also be written as
;x
;x
;error msg
; basically says if after a regsub on x the result isnt x, something is wrong, probably meta character
; I however like the "sub:" feature more due to its versatility.

sub: x,-,===,-
